Last updated: 2026-01-29
Owner: Product + Design

This guide is written for humans and AI agents. It defines the brand foundations, tone, and visual direction.
Do not invent missing information. If a field is listed as a placeholder, confirm with the owner.
Scope note: Product scope, IA, compliance, and functional requirements live in `project.md`.

## Brand summary
- Purpose: A steady, warm, grounded space to reconnect with self and others.
- Positioning: Person-centred, pluralistic, trauma-informed, inclusive counselling with a nature-forward calm.
- Audience: Teens and adults across NZ, with primary focus areas: identity/shame, relationships, burnout/work stress.
- Promise style: No guarantees. No clinical claims. Warm, clear, collaborative language.

## Brand voice and tone
Primary tone: human, calm, plain-language, non-clinical, non-promissory.

Voice principles:
- Speak like a steady, respectful human. Avoid therapy jargon and marketing hype.
- Be specific about what is offered and what is not offered.
- Be gentle and inclusive. Avoid assumptions about identity, culture, or relationship structure.

Do:
- Use short sentences and clear headings.
- Acknowledge uncertainty and choice.
- Use everyday language ("talk", "work through", "make sense of").

Do not:
- Promise outcomes or cures.
- Use clinical labels without consent or qualification.
- Use high-pressure sales language.

## Messaging guardrails
- Always include a non-emergency disclaimer where relevant.
- State confidentiality and its limits in plain language.
- Reference NZ compliance obligations (Privacy Act 2020, HIPC 2020, HDC Code of Rights, NZAC Code of Ethics).
- Do not use testimonials with identifiable client information.

## Visual principles
- Calm, grounded, nature-forward.
- Warm neutrals with muted greens; low visual noise.
- Generous whitespace, rounded corners, soft shadows.

## Logo and wordmark
- Current state: wordmark only. No standalone logo mark is defined.
- Do not create a new logo mark or lockup without approval.
- Use the wordmark consistently in the header and footer.

## Imagery and photography
Primary image themes:
- Nature textures (harbour water, bush, mist, soft light).
- Calm, minimal compositions with shallow depth of field.
- Warm neutral and sage palettes.

Headshots:
- Use authentic photography of Vince with soft, natural light.
- Avoid staged office or handshake imagery.

Do:
- Favor soft light, muted color, and a quiet atmosphere.
- Use negative space to allow text overlays.

Do not:
- Use busy, high-contrast, or high-saturation scenes.
- Use images with people unless it is an approved headshot.
- Use stock imagery that feels clinical or corporate.

## Iconography
Icon style must match the current site icons in `components/Icons.tsx`.

Specs:
- Canvas: 24x24
- Stroke: 1.6, rounded line joins/caps
- Fill: none
- Corners: soft, organic curves
- Color: `forest` (primary), or `forest/70` for secondary use

Do:
- Keep icons simple and symbolic (leaf, link, flame, shield).
- Ensure icons read clearly at 16-24px.

Do not:
- Use filled icons or heavy strokes.
- Use sharp angles or geometric tech styling.

## Illustration and graphic shapes
- Soft organic shapes, layered paper textures, subtle gradients.
- Avoid high-contrast or neon accents.
- Keep detail minimal and breathable.

## Image prompt creator
Use this template to generate brand-conforming AI imagery.

Prompt template:
"{subject}, {setting}, soft natural light, muted sage and warm cream palette, minimal composition, gentle grain, calm atmosphere, no people, no text, wide landscape"

Add-on descriptors (pick 1-3):
- "mist rolling over calm water"
- "soft fog and filtered morning light"
- "subtle paper texture"
- "shallow depth of field"
- "cinematic depth with soft haze"

Negative prompt (append as needed):
"people, faces, hands, text, signage, logos, high contrast, neon, harsh shadows, clinical office, city crowds"

Example:
"Soft coastal harbour at dawn, mist rolling over calm water, soft natural light, muted sage and warm cream palette, minimal composition, gentle grain, calm atmosphere, no people, no text, wide landscape"

## Accessibility and inclusion
- Prioritise contrast, readable type sizes, and clear focus states.
- Use inclusive language (no assumptions about gender, identity, or relationship structure).
- Ensure imagery does not exclude or stereotype.

## Required content blocks
Ensure all core content blocks are present per `AGENTS.md`:
- Positioning line, fit/not-fit, how it works, confidentiality, online safety, NZ context, fees transparency.

## Brand governance
- Primary CTA is a single choice sitewide. Do not invent it; confirm with the owner.
- Any new visual style change should update `docs/brand/STYLEGUIDE.md`.

## Fill-in fields (do not guess)
- Credentials/qualifications
