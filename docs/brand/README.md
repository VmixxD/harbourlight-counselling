# Brand Documentation

This folder holds the canonical brand guideline and UI styleguide for the Harbourlight Counselling website.

- `docs/brand/BRAND_GUIDE.md` - voice, imagery, iconography, brand guardrails, and prompt guidance.
- `docs/brand/STYLEGUIDE.md` - colors, typography, spacing, components, and motion tokens used in the site.

Use these files as the single source of truth for all design, copy, and asset decisions.
For product scope, IA, compliance, and functional requirements, refer to `project.md`.
